        <h3>Defination of List</h3>
       <p>HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain- <br>
        An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets. <br>
        An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items. <br>
        A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary. <br>
